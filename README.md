The following directories are for the main evaluation that compares Dias vs Pandas and Modin:
- `notebooks`
- `runner`
- `stats` (has the plotting code)

For these experiments, take a look at `REPRODUCE.md`.

The directory `pandas-replacements` has experiments on the pandas replacements (Table 2 in the paper).
